# WindEdit
A high performace text editor for huge file and long line.

_Hello WindEdit :rose:, hello world!_

**If you want a high performance SSH/Telnet/Serial/Shell client, you can try [WindTerm](https://github.com/kingtoolbox/windterm).**

# Background
When developing [WindTerm](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm), I need a colored text component, so WindEdit was created as a by-product. Hope it is a good by-product.

# License
Completely FREE for commercial and non-commercial use without limitations.

# Source Code

Since WindEdit is just a by-product of WindTerm, and all the source code is shared with WindTerm, if you have any source code requirements, please visit [WindTerm](https://github.com/kingtoolbox/windterm).

Please note that neither WindTerm nor WindEdit is a **partial** open source project.
